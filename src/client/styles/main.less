// ## Variables
// Global variables are defined in /src/styles/main.variables.
//

// ## Theme
// Theme-related styles are specified in /src/styles/themes/main.less.
// Any customization options are explained in more detail there.
//
// Note: The folders `/src/styles/site` and `/src/styles/themes` should not be
//       renamed as their location is determinated by /theme.config as well as
//       the structure of /node_modules/semantic-ui-less/**.
//

// ## Processing Pipeline
// All less styles are processed with `gulp styles` or any of the depending
// tasks including `gulp watch`. All **/main.less files are collected and concatenated
// into a single dist/main.css file and do not need to be cross-imported from this file.
//
// Any file following another naming convention needs to be explicitly imported from
// one of the main.less files using `@import 'path/to/file';`.
//
// During `gulp watch` reprocessing is triggered if any of the following files changes:
// - /theme.config
// - /src/**/*.css
// - /src/**/*.less
// - /src/**/*.overrides
// - /src/**/*.variables
//

// ## CSS3 Calculation
// All files except those used for theming are LESS-compiled in strict math and units mode.
// For calculations to be evaluated by LESS they are required to be put in parenthesis.
// In order to use the CSS3 <calc(...)> statement without it being processed
// in LESS no further steps are needed for files in standard pipeline.
//
// On the other hand, any file referenced from ./src/styles/themes/main.less including
// ui theming is run in non-strict math and units mode and, therefore, needs escaping
// as explained there.
